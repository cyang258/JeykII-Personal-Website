This is what a typical day would looks like in ruby. And yes I was graduated from Lighthouse Labs(Yeahhhhh). I just found out there are still so many things I need to do. But first I recommand you guys to put <b>Job Hunting</b> as first mission need to be completed.

Why? Well, learning could be a much more fun thing to do, but hi, you have to reach out real people to know what real world demand is. And the most important part is you need to work to expand your stack and get more experience. Experience will allow us to generate more effcient code as well as to aware of where and how to solve an error when it occurs.

For the next blog, I will share more about crash interview questions. Cheers!
