This is a project I've been working on this week, and the outcome is pretty good. So I tried to practice my Ruby on Rails skill, and this project takes me about 3 days(2-3 hours a day) from idea to finished.

![crypto portfolio screenshot]({{ "/favicons/crypto/portfolio.png" | https://github.com/cyang258/crypto/blob/master/app/assets/images/portfolio.png }})
![add new crypto screenshot]({{ "/favicons/crypto/addNewCrypto.png" | https://github.com/cyang258/crypto/blob/master/app/assets/images/addNewCrypto.png }})

The idea of this project is to help users manage and monitor the change of their portfolio in an easier way. They can add crypto currencies they bought to their portfolio list with amount and cost. Then the app will use coinmarketcap.com API to monitor the current price and recent price change. Also, app will caculate the profit and loss. I use Ruby on Rails for this project. And as I promised on last blog, I will write several blogs to explain how do I finish this project and what kind of issues I have during development. If you want to get the code of this project, feel free to visit my Github [here][1].
