After one week of study, I build another app called tweeter.

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone build with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX in front-end along with Node, Express, MongoDB in back-end that allows users to post tweets and share with others. I also build in moment js in order to show when tweets were created.

This is how it looks like as a full product:

You could download this app from my [Github][1].
