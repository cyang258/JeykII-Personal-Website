Finally, I am here now. This is the last project before final project and after final I will be graduated from the program.

This week, we learned Rudy on Rails and created a mini e-commerce site by using PostgreSQL, Rails and Stripe.

Generally speaking, I found Rails makes creating websites much more easier. And codes are also much cleaner. And this is how my project looks like:
