I learned about this JavaScript framework from a Tech Coding Interview I had last week. I find this framework is really easy to use and maintain and the codes can be really clean. So I learned this framework and built this application.

The idea of this application is to help users to save their recipe and manage their meals. Also shopping list feature helps users for the grocery shopping.

![my recipe book main dashboard screenshot]({{ "/favicons/my-recipe-book/RecipeBook.png"|https://github.com/cyang258/Recipe-book/blob/master/lib/image/RecipeBook.png}})

As you can see, the application has three features right now: Recipe Book, Menu and Shopping List.

Recipe Book feature allows users to save their own recipes, they can add a description or memo and quantity of the ingredients. once they save the recipe, then the recipe is be able to add in menu.

![my recipe book add menu screenshot]({{ "/favicons/my-recipe-book/add_to_Menu.png"|https://github.com/cyang258/Recipe-book/blob/master/lib/image/Add_to_Menu.png}})

![my recipe book menu screenshot]({{ "/favicons/my-recipe-book/Menu.png"|https://github.com/cyang258/Recipe-book/blob/master/lib/image/Menu.png}})

In the screenshot above, I added Ahi Tuna to menu. And when I go to menu page, the Ahi Tuna is inside. 

![my recipe book shopping list screenshot]({{ "/favicons/my-recipe-book/ShoppingList.png"|https://github.com/cyang258/Recipe-book/blob/master/lib/image/ShoppingList.png}})

Once recipes were added to menu, all of the ingredients of the recipe will be added to shopping list. So all user need to do is go to store and buy the stuffs in shopping list.
