Hello, everyone

After I studied JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js. I created a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs. 

And here is how it looks like blow:

After you login, you can generate random number/letter combination which allows you to access A Certain Website Address that you assigned. You can edit or delete it as you can see below:
