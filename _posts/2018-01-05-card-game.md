Time went by really fast when you had happy time and enjoy what you were doing. My curricumlum just right in the middle of it and our mid-term has arrived.

This time I was assigned to group with another person, so it is a team project which need my partner and I collabrate with each other. We want to create something interesting and rarely being created in previous cohorts, so website game project really draws our attentions.

The period for this project is a week and a half, so we have enough time to figure out what kind of features and structure we want to have.

This is how our final product looks like.

And as you can see, when you start a game or mutiple games, it will give you a interface which you can switch current game by click different tabs on the top. When it is not your turn, tab letter will be in white color, otherwise, it will turn red.
