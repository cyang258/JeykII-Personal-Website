Today is demo day for our final project. Same as mid-term, we have to pick a partner to work together. So my partner and I decided to do something interesting which is creating a broswer synthesizer, and we name it Musically.

This website gives users an intuitive and easy way to create music loops in the browser.Tech stack includes Tone.js handle browser audio, use React as front end and Express as backend, And I use PostgreSQL for Database. Right now, users can register an account and play with nodegrid and save their loops. And users can also import their saved loops from their collection to compose page and play it for fun. We really interested in this project and this project will continuing update.
