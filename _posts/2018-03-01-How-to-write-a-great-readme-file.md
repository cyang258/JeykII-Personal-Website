README files are a quick and simple way for other users to learn more about your work. Good README files usually include a title of the project, a brief description, the project's dependencies and any necessary setup steps to get the project running.

## Formating ReadMe File

```
# [name of project goes here]

## Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs. 

## Final product

![Image of how your final product looks like](Image URI)
* Also give some description about your product.


## Dependencies

- Dependency you have in your project
- Dependency you have in your project
- ...

## Installation

- Give the details about how to install your app
- Indicate if there are any environment need to be setup
- How to run the app

## Usage: You should instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

## Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[link text itself]: https://www.google.com/maps
```
### Images

[reference]: URI to the image
```

## You Are Done

After you adding all the things above, the Readme file should be pretty good now. And this will give readers a clear instruction on how to use your project.
