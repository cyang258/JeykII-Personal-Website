No one really knows how long it takes to get a Dev Job, and Job Hunting could be a long battle. TRUST ME! A less-talked about part of the bootcamper‚Äôs journey is what happens after you graduate - when you looking for that 5-figure developer role. Like the function I mention on last blog, that is my real daily routine right now. And I am guessing:

{% highlight ruby %}
def get_dev_job(study, patience, luck)
  prepared = study + patience + luck
  if prepared
    return true
  else
    return false
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Maybe this is the formula how to get my first job.

<b>What Should be Done After I Graduated?</b><br />
"Of course, finding yourself a job!"someone would say, but the trick part is how do you find your very first job since you don't even have your self brand reputation. The first things I did is to create a portfolio website as fast as possible. Why? I say this because when I have my first interview, I was asked if I have one. Unfortunately, I wasn't graduated and didn't realize how important this is. People don‚Äôt really know you and they are not sure if you are ideal candidate for them if you don't have any meaty stuffs to show them. The best way to let them know that you can code is by showing them the projects you have on your Github and your portfolio website, and if you can deploy your project on platform like Heroku, Amazon, even better. However, I am guessing for the most company, they may check on your Github, but they usually don‚Äôt download and install your projects. One of my classmate shared one of his interview experience that the interviewer asked him to show the running projects on his computer. So personal website is very important to let HR really know that you can code well and also it can give HR a good first impression if your website is good enough.

Second thing you need to do is revise your resume properly. 
Resumes need to be consistently updated with all your skills, experience, and projects. And here are some notes for resume:
‚ú∂Put new projects first
‚ú∂List what technologies you used for each project
‚ú∂Include an explanation of what your app does

Next thing need to setup is your social media account. Tweeter, Facebook(Not really recommand though), Linkedin, ect. Change your status to something like "Full Stack Developer seeking for opportunities". Follow any company you are interested in and let your friends know that you are looking for a Developer position so that if they know any opportunities, they can refer you to the company.

Final thing, MEET PEOPLE, CONTINUE TO CODE and PREPARE INTERVIEW are also very important!	

<b>What Should be Prepared For The Interview?</b><br />
For the interview, you have to prepare for two parts - The technical part and normal part.

For nomarl part, there is really nothing new to say. If you formal programming experience, just talk about it. If you are not, just focus more on your passion and love on coding. Tell them more about how fast you can absorb the knowledge and you could be a valuable assets for the company in very soon future. Also make sure you did good research about the company. Knowing what kind of business they are doing and what they need the most.

For the tech part, currently I am more focusing on Data Structure and Algorithm. There are abundant of resources online like Udemy, Lynda.com, stackoverflow, ect. All you need to do is google them out and pick one that you feel most comfortable with to study.

Here are some links I found useful to me. Hope this will helps you as well:

üî∞ For Tech interview <br />
 ‚ú≥Ô∏è[CodeFight][3]: <i>someone may mention hackerRank, but I found CodeFight is more game-like which meaning more interesting and fun.</i> <br />
 ‚ú≥Ô∏è[10 Interview Questions Every JavaScript Developer Should Know][1] <br />
 ‚ú≥Ô∏è[Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions][2]: <i>This book was mentioned by a lot of people I know. You can buy it if you are interested.</i>

 üî∞For resume <br />
 ‚ú≥Ô∏è[creddle.io][4] : A really helpful resume website. It provides nice themes, so all you need to think about is how to write the content. <br />
 ‚ú≥Ô∏èUdemy: Udemy provide a lot of courses and some of it is how to nail the interviews and how to write resume. Sometimes there are also free courses. Really worth to check it out.

 üî∞For Job Hunting website <br />
 I live nearby Toronto, Canada. So currently I found Indeed, Glassdoor and Linkedin are the most reliable website. I tried some website like riipen.io, Startup North, ect. It seems like they are pretty new, never work out on me. If you know anymore good resources, feel free to email me below. I will add those in the blog. And there is one more thing you need to know is that companies do not release all the open position on website. Those position only open to the person who have reference from a trusted person of the company. <i><b>SO ATTENDING MEETUP EVENT IS IMPORTANT!</b></i>

 For the next few blogs, I will open a new category called Developing which will blog almost everything about the project I am currently work on. I am currently using Ruby on Rails create a cool Crypto Currency Portfolio app, so you will see how I create it and all kind of issues I might need to figure out.
